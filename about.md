# ![FGFIMG](/images/fglogo_64.png) About FutureGateway Framework
The [FutureGateway Framework][FGF] has been initialy developed and simply called the [FutureGateway][FG] in the context of the European project [INDIGO-dc][INDIGO-DC], further developments have been added in the context of the European project [EOSC-hub][EOSC-HUB] providing its final shape of a complete Framework.

Outside the context of the projects above, the FGF initiative is managed by the [INFN][INFN] [Division of Catania][INFNCT].
