# About
This meeting tries to create the correct roadmap for developing the new InvenioRDM digital asset management system. The goal of the meeting consists of mock-up analisys, data models discussions made among developers and final users. The RRP has been presented beside the [INFN OpenAccess repository][INFNOAR] as interested party especially for retrieving DOIs and their related hierarchy through the use of REST APIs.
The RRP can be considered a good integration between the [Science Softeare on Demand][SSOD] service, powered by the [FutureGateway Science Gateway][FGSG].
During the participation the need to extract via RESTful APIs selected DOIs following their hierarchy, has been highlighted as a core component of the RRP system.
