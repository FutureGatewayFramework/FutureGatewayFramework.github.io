In the context of the [EOSC-hub][EOSCHUB] european project, has been developed the [Science Software on Demand][SSOD](SSOD) a Science Gateway portal based on [FutureGateway Framework][FGF](FGF) and registered as service in the [EGI][EGI] infrastructure. The portal principally acts as a demonstrator and it provides a set of scientific applications as demonstrative use cases. The SSOD relies on a backend solution named [FutureGateway ScienceGateway][FGSG](FGSG), a combination of hardware and software solutions making use of the [FGF][FGF] components to host one or more Science Gateways. Moreover thanks to its fully [dockerized][DOCKER] implementation the each gateway can offer virtualized resources to its users in the form of SaaS and PaaS.

Below a description of its internal architecture regardless the [FGSG][FGSG] back-end environment.
